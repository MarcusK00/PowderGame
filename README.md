# ðŸ§ª Powder Game Clone â€“ Element Simulation in Pygame

A 2D sandbox simulation game inspired by Dan-Ball's Powder Game. Built with Python and Pygame, this project allows users to experiment with different elements that interact in unique, rule-based ways (e.g. oil goes on top of water, fire burns oil, water flows naturally, sand falls, etc.)

## ðŸ§  About

This is a simple yet interactive physics simulation where users "paint" elements onto a grid and observe how they interact. It was created as a learning project to explore:

- Particle systems
- Real-time updates using Pygame
- Custom element interaction logic
- Optimization techniques for simulations

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- Multiple elements (e.g., sand, water, fire, stone, oil, etc.)
- Left-click to place elements, right-click to erase
- Different behaviors and reactions for each material
- Simple brush system

---

## ðŸŽ® Controls

- **Left Click** â€“ Place selected element  
- **Right Click** â€“ Erase element  
- **Scroll** - Change Brush Size
- **Number Keys (1-9)** â€“ Switch between elements
- **K / L** - Change Resolution
- **ESC** â€“ Reset simulation  

> All logic is contained in a single Python script. It started as a simple sand falling simulator.
